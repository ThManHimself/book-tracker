## Usage
This app was created with Node.js and uses Express.js in order to create a RESTful API. Handlebars.js is used for templating. MySQL, JAWS.db, and Sequelize were used to create and manipulate the database. CSS was customized through the use of Materialize. This app can be run on a local server or through the internet at the deployed app https://dry-wildwood-65158.herokuapp.com/.
A user can retrieve data about books they have previously entered into the app's database as well as add new book information through their dashboard.

## Tests
Seed files are included and allowed for easier testing during production using the Insomnia Core app. We found Nodemon to be a helpful tool during development as it allowed for faster and easier testing through the browser as it refreshes node.js when any change are made in the files.
